## Data Types

Morse-STF defines three data types: `class PrivateTensor`, `class SharedTensor`, `class SharedPair`.

### PrivateTensor

`PrivateTensor` represnts private data owned by one party. It contains an `inner_value` of type `tf.Tensor of dtype = int64`, `int module` , `int fixedpoint`, and `owner`.  
When `module is None`, a fixed-point number is defined, which represents `inner_value*pow(2,-fixedpoint)`. When `module is not None`, it defines a tensor of `module`-factorial cyclic group.

### SharedTensor 
`SharedTensor`contains `inner_value` and `module`.

### SharedPair 
`SharedPair` contains `xL`, `xR`, `ownerL`, `ownerR`, `fixedpoint`. Both `(xL, xR)` are `SharedTensor`. In particular, `ownerL != ownerR` and `xL.module == xR.module`.  
When `module is None`, a fixed-point number is defined, which represents `(xL.inner_value + xR.inner_value mod pow(2,64)) * pow(2, -fixedpoint)`. When `module is not None`, it defines a tensor of `module`-factorial cyclic group, which represents `(xL.inner_value + xR.inner_value mod module)`.

## Load Data
`PrivateTensor` can load data from a (local or federated) server.
To get 'const PrivateTensor', you can use `load_from_numpy()`, `load_from_tf_tensor`.
To get `non-const PrivateTensor`, you can use `load_first_line_from_file()`, `load_from_file`, `load_from_file_withid()`

You can load data using `load_from_file()` by following the example below.

```
    x_train = PrivateTensor(owner='L')
    format_x = [["a"], [0.1], [0.1], [0.1], [0.1], [0.1]]
    x_train.load_from_file(path=path, record_defaults=format_x, batch_size=batch_size, repeat=repeat, skip_col_num=1)
```

`path` is absolute path; `format_x` is data type; `batch_size` is the size of the loading data at each batch; `repeat` is the times of reading data; `skip_col_num` is the number of collums that are skiped.

## Build the model

### Linear Regression

You can build linear regression with one-party private inputs by:
```
    from stensorflow.ml.logistic_regression import LogisticRegression
    model = LogisticRegression(num_features=featureNum, learning_rate=learning_rate)
```
`num_features` is the number of features; `learning_rate` is the learning rate of model training.

You can build linear regression with two-party private inputs by:
```
    from stensorflow.ml.logistic_regression2 import LogisticRegression2
    model = LogisticRegression2(learning_rate=learning_rate, num_features_L=featureNumL, num_features_R=featureNumR)
```
`learning_rate` is the learning rate of model training; `num_features_L` is the number of private features owned by party `workerL`; `num_features_R` is the number of private features owned by party `workerR`.

### Fully Connected Model 

You can build the fully connected model with one-party private inputs by:
```
    from stensorflow.ml.nn.networks.DNN import DNN
    model = DNN(feature=x_train, label=y_train, dense_dims=dense_dims)
    model.compile()
```
`feature` is a `PrivateTensor` representing features; `label` is a `PrivateTensor` representing labels; `dense_dims` is a `list` of type `int`, representing the number of neurons at each layer.

You can build fully connected model (FCM) with two-party private inputs by:
```
    from stensorflow.ml.nn.networks.DNN import DNN
    model = DNN(feature=xL_train, label=y_train, dense_dims=dense_dims, feature_another=xR_train)
    model.compile()
```
Both `feature`, `feature_another` are `PrivateTensor` representing features; `label` is a `PrivateTensor` representing labels; `dense_dims` is a `list` of type `int`, representing the number of neurons at each layer.

### Convolutional Neural Network 
You can build Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with one-party private inputs by:
```
    from stensorflow.ml.nn.networks.NETWORKB import NETWORKB
    model = NETWORKB(feature=x_train, label=y_train, loss="CrossEntropyLossWithSoftmax")
    model.compile()
```
`feature` is a `PrivateTensor` representing features; `label` is a `PrivateTensor` representing labels; `loss` defines the loss function.
The layers for `NETWORKB` are described below,
```
    Conv2D(16,(5,5), activation='relu', use_bias=False),
    AvgPool2D(2,2),
    Conv2D(16,(5,5), activation='relu', use_bias=False),
    AvgPool2D(2,2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(100, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, name="Dense"),
    Activation('softmax')
```
`NETWORKA`, `NETWORKC`, and `NETWORKD` follow the same format. See [here]().

## Model Training

### Initialization

Before training a model, you need to initialize `Session` and `Variable`.
```
     sess = tf.compat.v1.Session(StfConfig.target)
     init_op = tf.compat.v1.initialize_all_variables()
     sess.run(init_op)
```

### Start Training 

You can train linear regression with one-party private inputs by
```
     model.fit(sess=sess, x=x_train, y=y_train, num_batches=train_batch_num)
```

You can train linear regression with two-party private inputs by
```
     model.fit(sess, x_L=xL_train, x_R=xR_train, y=y_train, num_batches=train_batch_num)
```

You can train FCM/CNN with one/two-party private inputs by
```
     model.train_sgd(learning_rate=learning_rate, batch_num=train_batch_num, l2_regularization=l2_regularization, sess=sess)
```

## Model Prediction

For linear regression with one-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict(id,x_test, pred_batch_num, sess, predict_file=None)
```

For linear regression with two-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict(id, xL_test, xR_test, pred_batch_num, sess, predict_file=None)
```

For fully connected model with one-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict_to_file(sess=sess, x=x_test, predict_file_name=StfConfig.predict_to_file, batch_num=pred_batch_num, idx=id)
```

For fully connected model with two-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict_to_file(sess=sess, x=xL_test, x_another=xR_test, predict_file_name=StfConfig.predict_to_file, batch_num=pred_batch_num, idx=id)
```

For FCN with one-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict_to_file(sess=sess, x=x_test, predict_file_name=StfConfig.predict_to_file, batch_num=pred_batch_num, idx=id)
```

For FCN with two-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict_to_file(sess=sess, x=xL_test, x_another=xR_test, predict_file_name=StfConfig.predict_to_file, batch_num=pred_batch_num, idx=id)
```

For CNN with one-party private inputs, you could use
```
    model.predict_to_file(sess, x_test, predict_file_name=StfConfig.predict_to_file, pred_batch_num=pred_batch_num, with_sigmoid=False)
```

## Choose Your Protocol

Morse-STF allows users to choose their MPC protocols (for DReLU), including `const`, `log`, and `linear`. You could configure `protocols` in `config.json`. For example,
```
    "protocols":{
    	"drelu": "log"
    }
```
